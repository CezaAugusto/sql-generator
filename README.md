# sql-generator

This project works like a sql generator (but can be used for anything else) from an excel spreadsheet

### Motivation

```ssh 
I did this project thinking about a problem I was having.
It probably won't satisfy your needs without being modified.
```

### Run

- create the tmp folder and place your spreadsheet inside it
- change the import of the excel spreadsheet in the exports.js file (pathXlsxFile)
- run the following command on the terminal
```ssh 
 node run.js 
```
